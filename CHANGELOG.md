## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- Paste clipboard text into a live terminal with right-click.
- Close Codex terminals predictably after confirmed double-`Ctrl+C`, or when
  an explicit `/exit` or `/quit` command leaves the terminal process attached.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Allow open terminal tabs to be reordered by dragging or with
  `Alt+Shift+Left` and `Alt+Shift+Right` while a tab is focused. Visual tab
  order remains independent from the `Ctrl+Tab` most-recently-used switcher.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Initial Lumora MVP release for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
